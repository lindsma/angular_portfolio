  <div class='about-description'>
    <p class='dev'>I'm a Junior Front-End Engineer with a passion for creating. After four years in digital advertising, watching admiringly as our talented developers created insane campaigns for huge clients, I decided it was a skill I had a serious interest in learning.</p>
    <p class='personal'>When I need a break from the computer screen, I enjoy creating in the kitchen! I'm down for the challenge of anything from sushi to the temperamental French Macaron.</p>
